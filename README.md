# Wickerman OS

**Self-hosted AI operating system.** Run local language models, chain them into pipelines, and manage everything from a single dashboard. No cloud required.

## What Is This?

Wickerman OS is a Docker-based platform that turns your machine into a local AI command center. It bundles model inference, chat, visual pipelines, model training, and code generation behind a single installer and web dashboard.

**Key features:**
- **Model Router** — Load multiple local models simultaneously, configure them as agents with system prompts, RAG memory, and custom settings. Also supports remote APIs (OpenAI, Anthropic, Google Gemini) behind the same unified endpoint.
- **Chat** — Multi-conversation UI with per-chat agent selection. Conversations persist server-side.
- **Flow Editor** — Visual drag-and-drop pipeline builder (Flowise). Chain agents together.
- **Model Trainer** — Fine-tune models with LoRA using Unsloth.
- **Code Forge** — AI-assisted coding sandbox.
- **RAG Memory** — Each agent has its own FAISS-powered vector memory. Old conversation context is automatically archived and retrieved when relevant.

## Requirements

- **OS:** Linux (tested on Pop!_OS / Ubuntu 22.04+)
- **Docker:** Docker Engine 20.10+
- **GPU:** NVIDIA GPU recommended (CUDA support). CPU-only mode available.
- **RAM:** 16GB+ recommended
- **Disk:** 20GB+ for the platform, plus space for models

## Quick Start

```bash
# Clone the repo
git clone https://github.com/Tabulanis/wickerman-os.git ~/aidojo
cd ~/aidojo

# (Optional) Add GGUF models to the models/ directory
# cp /path/to/your-model.gguf models/

# Install
sudo python3 wickermaninstall.py

# Start
cd ~/wickerman && sudo ./start.sh
```

Open `http://wickerman.local` in your browser.

## First Steps

1. **Install the Model Router** — Click INSTALL on the Model Router card. First build takes ~10 minutes (compiles llama.cpp with CUDA).
2. **Load a model** — Open the Model Router, configure a model with a system prompt and settings, click "Load agent".
3. **Install Chat** — Click INSTALL on the Chat card. Open it, pick your agent, start chatting.
4. **Browse the Codex** — The Codex tab has full documentation, searchable.

~/wickerman/                       # Runtime (generated on install)
~/WickermanSupport/                # Persistent data (survives reinstall)
  models/                         # Your GGUF model files
  plugins/                        # Plugin manifests and data
  datasets/                       # Training datasets
  loras/                          # Fine-tuned adapters
```

## Architecture

All inference flows through the Model Router's unified `/v1/chat/completions` endpoint, regardless of whether the model runs locally or via a remote API.

- **Model Router** manages agents (local llama.cpp + remote APIs), RAG memory, system prompts, and settings
- **Chat** is a thin conversation UI that picks an agent and manages history
- **Flow Editor** chains agents into visual pipelines
- All plugins talk to the Router — they never know where inference happens

## Agents

An agent is a fully configured AI endpoint: a model (local or remote) with a system prompt, RAG memory, and sampling settings baked in. Create them in the Model Router dashboard.

## API

The Model Router exposes an OpenAI-compatible API:

```bash
# Chat with an agent
curl http://localhost:8080/v1/chat/completions \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"model": "code-assistant", "messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "Hello"}]}'

# List loaded agents
curl http://localhost:8080/v1/models

# Get VRAM usage
curl http://localhost:8080/api/vram
```

## Models

Place `.gguf` files in the `models/` directory before installing, or use the built-in Downloader after installation.

Tested models:
- **Qwen2.5-Coder-14B** (Q5_K_M / Q8_0) — excellent for coding
- **TinyLlama 1.1B** (Q4_K_M) — fast test/fallback model
- **all-MiniLM-L6-v2** — embedding model for RAG memory

## Reinstalling / Updating

```bash
cd ~/aidojo
git pull
sudo python3 wickermaninstall.py
```

Your models, datasets, and plugin data in `~/WickermanSupport/` survive reinstalls. For a complete reset: `sudo python3 wickermaninstall.py --hard-reset`

## Development

### Dev Container (recommended)

The repo includes a [devcontainer](.devcontainer/) that provides Python 3.11, pytest, ruff, mypy, and Claude Code pre-installed.

**VS Code:** Open the repo, click "Reopen in Container" when prompted (requires the [Dev Containers](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-vscode-remote.remote-containers) extension).

**Standalone (any terminal):**
```bash
# Set GH_TOKEN for git push from inside the container
export GH_TOKEN=ghp_your_token_here  # or add to ~/.bashrc

docker compose -f docker-compose.dev.yml build
docker compose -f docker-compose.dev.yml up -d
docker compose -f docker-compose.dev.yml exec dev zsh
# Inside: make test, make lint, gh, claude, etc.
```

The container includes Python 3.11, pytest, ruff, mypy, gh CLI, Claude Code, and a network firewall restricting outbound to an allowlist. See [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md) for details.

### Dev Commands

```bash
make dev        # Install dev dependencies
make test       # Run pytest
make lint       # Run ruff
make format     # Auto-format with ruff
make typecheck  # Run mypy
make ci         # lint + test
```
