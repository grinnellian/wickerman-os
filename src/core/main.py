# WICKERMAN CODEX

Welcome to Wickerman OS v5.2.0 — your local AI command center. Everything runs on your machine, no cloud required.

## Getting Started

When you first load the dashboard, you'll see four tabs across the top: **Plugins**, **Source**, **Codex** (you're here), and **System**.

### The Plugins Tab

Your home screen. Every available AI tool shows as a card with a status badge:

- **not installed** — click INSTALL to set it up.
- **running** — click OPEN to use it, or KILL to stop it.
- **stopped / error** — check the console log at the bottom for details.

Click OPEN to load a plugin in a new tab inside the dashboard. Multiple plugins can be open at once.

### The Source Tab

Version control panel. Every change — installing a plugin, removing one, updating nginx — is automatically tracked by Git.

- **Working Changes** — files modified since last save (green = new, amber = modified, red = deleted)
- **Manual Commit** — save a snapshot with a description
- **Timeline** — full history with diffs

### The Codex Tab

You're reading it. The full documentation for Wickerman OS. Use the search bar above to find what you need.

### The System Tab

Maintenance: prune Docker containers/images to free disk space. Shows GPU status and session info.

## Core Architecture

Wickerman OS is built around a central **Model Router** that manages AI inference. All other plugins talk to it through a unified API.

```
Model Router (wm-llama)
  ├── Local Agents (llama.cpp on GPU/CPU)
  │     Each agent = model + system prompt + RAG + settings
  ├── Remote Providers (OpenAI, Anthropic, Google, custom)
  │     Same API, different backend
  └── /v1/chat/completions (OpenAI-compatible)
        ├── Chat plugin → conversation UI
        ├── Flow Editor → visual pipelines
        └── Code Forge → AI coding sandbox
```

## Your Plugins

Wickerman ships with five plugins:

| Plugin | What It Does |
|--------|-------------|
| **Model Router** | Agent orchestration hub. Manages local models + remote APIs. Handles system prompts, RAG memory, and inference settings. This is the brain — all other plugins talk to it. |
| **Chat** | Conversation UI. Pick an agent, chat with it. Conversations persist server-side. The agent's personality, RAG memory, and settings are configured in the Router. |
| **Flow Editor** | Visual drag-and-drop editor for building AI pipelines (powered by Flowise). Chain multiple agents together. |
| **Model Trainer** | Fine-tune models with LoRA using Unsloth. Upload a dataset, train, export. |
| **Code Forge** | AI-assisted coding sandbox. Describe what you want, the AI writes and runs it. |

**Install order matters.** Install the Model Router first — Chat, Flow Editor, and Code Forge all depend on it for inference.

## Agents

An **agent** is a fully configured AI endpoint: a model (local or remote) with a system prompt, RAG memory, and sampling settings baked in. You create agents in the Model Router dashboard.

Example agents:
- **code-assistant** — Qwen-14B with "You are a senior Python developer" prompt, RAG loaded with project docs, temperature 0.3
- **creative-writer** — TinyLlama with "You are a creative storyteller" prompt, temperature 0.9
- **gpt4-analyst** — GPT-4o via OpenAI API with "You are a data analyst" prompt

When you chat or build flows, you pick an agent by name. The Router handles everything behind the scenes.

## RAG (Retrieval Augmented Generation)

Each agent has its own RAG memory powered by FAISS vector search. When a conversation gets too long:

1. Oldest messages are **trimmed** from the context window
2. Trimmed messages are **archived** to the agent's FAISS index
3. Before each response, the Router **searches** the index for relevant context
4. Relevant chunks are **injected** into the prompt

This gives agents effectively infinite memory — old conversations are never truly lost.

RAG is enabled per-agent in the Model Router dashboard. Each agent's memory is isolated (no cross-contamination between agents).

## Remote Providers

The Model Router can proxy requests to external AI APIs:

| Provider | Type | Covers |
|----------|------|--------|
| **OpenAI-compatible** | `openai` | OpenAI, Groq, Together, OpenRouter, local Ollama/LM Studio |
| **Anthropic** | `anthropic` | Claude models (text-only, Messages API translation) |
| **Google** | `google` | Gemini models (text-only, generateContent translation) |
| **Custom** | `custom` | Any OpenAI-compatible endpoint |

Add providers in the Model Router dashboard under the "Remote providers" tab. API keys are stored locally with restricted permissions.

## Downloading Models

Two ways to get models:

1. **Local directory** — Place `.gguf` files in `~/aidojo/models/` before running the installer. They're copied to `~/WickermanSupport/models/` on install.
2. **Downloader plugin** — Browse HuggingFace, search for a model, pick a quantization, download directly to the models directory.

Recommended models:
- **Qwen2.5-Coder-14B Q5_K_M** — excellent for coding (12GB VRAM)
- **TinyLlama 1.1B Q4_K_M** — fast test/fallback model (600MB)
- **all-MiniLM-L6-v2** — embedding model for RAG (45MB, runs on CPU)

## Where Your Files Live

| Location | What's There | Survives Reinstall? |
|----------|-------------|-------------------|
| `~/aidojo/` | Installer, plugin source code, local models | Source of truth |
| `~/wickerman/` | Dashboard, nginx, docker-compose | No (recreated on install) |
| `~/WickermanSupport/` | Models, datasets, plugin data, configs | **Yes** |
| `~/WickermanSupport/models/` | Your GGUF model files | **Yes** |
| `~/WickermanSupport/plugins/` | Plugin manifests | **Yes** |

The golden rule: anything in `~/WickermanSupport/` survives a `--hard-reset`. Your models, datasets, and plugin customizations are safe.

## API Reference

All inference goes through the Model Router at `http://wm-llama:8080`:

| Endpoint | Method | Description |
|----------|--------|-------------|
| `/v1/chat/completions` | POST | Chat with an agent (OpenAI-compatible) |
| `/v1/models` | GET | List loaded agents |
| `/v1/embeddings` | POST | Get text embeddings |
| `/api/status` | GET | Router status, all agents |
| `/api/models` | GET | Available model files |
| `/api/slots/load` | POST | Load a local agent |
| `/api/slots/unload` | POST | Unload an agent |
| `/api/slots/update` | POST | Update agent settings live |
| `/api/providers/add` | POST | Add a remote provider |
| `/api/vram` | GET | GPU VRAM usage |
| `/api/rag/<id>/status` | GET | RAG index status |
| `/api/rag/<id>/search` | POST | Search RAG index |
| `/api/rag/<id>/clear` | POST | Clear RAG index |
| `/api/rag/<id>/archive` | POST | Archive messages to RAG |

Chat plugin API at `http://wm-chat:5000`:

| Endpoint | Method | Description |
|----------|--------|-------------|
| `/api/agents` | GET | List available agents (from router) |
| `/api/conversations` | GET/POST | List or create conversations |
| `/api/conversations/<id>` | GET/PUT/DELETE | Manage a conversation |
| `/api/conversations/<id>/chat` | POST | Send a message |
| `/api/conversations/<id>/context` | GET | Context usage info |

## Volume Tokens (For Plugin Authors)

| Token | Resolves to |
|-------|-------------|
| `{self}` | `~/WickermanSupport/plugins/<plugin-id>` |
| `{models}` | `~/WickermanSupport/models/` |
| `{datasets}` | `~/WickermanSupport/datasets/` |
| `{loras}` | `~/WickermanSupport/loras/` |
| `{support}` | `~/WickermanSupport/` |
| `{workspace}` | `~/wickerman/workspace/` |

## Common Issues

**Plugin shows "502 Bad Gateway"** — The plugin container is still starting up. The Model Router needs ~10 minutes on first run to compile llama.cpp with CUDA. Wait and refresh.

**Chat says "Cannot reach Model Router"** — Install and start the Model Router plugin first.

**Model won't load (VRAM error)** — The model is too large for your GPU. Try loading with fewer GPU layers (set to 0 for CPU-only) or use a smaller quantization.

**RAG not working** — Ensure an embedding model (e.g., all-MiniLM-L6-v2) is loaded in the Router with alias "embedding". RAG needs embeddings to index and search.

**"llama.wickerman.local not found"** — The hostname isn't in /etc/hosts. Re-run the installer with `sudo`.

**Context overflow / 400 error** — The Router now handles this automatically via context trimming. If you still see it, the model may not have loaded correctly — check the Router dashboard.

## Security

The Docker socket (`/var/run/docker.sock`) is mounted into the dashboard container. This gives it full control over Docker. **Do not expose port 80 to the internet.** This is a local development tool.

API keys for remote providers are stored in plaintext at `/data/providers.json` with file permissions restricted to the container user. This is acceptable for a single-user local tool.

AI_PLUGIN_GUIDE = """
# CREATING YOUR OWN PLUGINS

A plugin is a JSON manifest file that tells Wickerman how to run a containerized AI tool.

## Quick Start

1. Create a file called `wm-yourtool.json`
2. Put it in `~/wickerman/plugins/` (or `~/WickermanSupport/plugins/`)
3. Click Refresh on the dashboard — your plugin appears

## Manifest Template

```json
{
  "name": "Your Tool Name",
  "description": "One-line description shown on the plugin card",
  "icon": "smart_toy",
  "image": "registry/image:tag",
  "container_name": "wm-yourtool",
  "url": "http://yourtool.wickerman.local",
  "ports": [8080],
  "gpu": false,
  "env": ["KEY=value", "ANOTHER=value"],
  "volumes": ["{self}/data:/data"],
  "nginx_host": "yourtool.wickerman.local",
  "help": "Markdown documentation shown in the Codex tab."
}
```

## Two Ways to Ship a Plugin

**Registry pull** — set `"image": "some/image:tag"`. Wickerman pulls it from Docker Hub. Simplest approach.

**Local build** — set `"build": true` and `"build_context": "data"`. Put a `Dockerfile` and your app code in the `files` dict. Wickerman extracts them and runs `docker build`. Use this when you need custom code.

## Rules

- `container_name` **must** start with `wm-`
- `ports[0]` is the port your app listens on inside the container
- `gpu: true` passes through your NVIDIA GPU (requires CUDA)
- `nginx_host` must be added to `/etc/hosts` pointing to `127.0.0.1`
- `network` defaults to `wm-net` — all plugins can talk to each other

## Node API (For Flow Editor Integration)

If you want your plugin to work as a node in Flow Editor, expose two endpoints:

- `GET /node/schema` — returns JSON describing your inputs and outputs
- `POST /node/execute` — accepts input JSON, returns output JSON

Example schema response:
```json
{
  "name": "mytool",
  "inputs": [
    {"name": "prompt", "type": "string", "required": true}
  ],
  "outputs": [
    {"name": "result", "type": "string"}
  ]
}
```

Flow Editor can then call your plugin via an HTTP Request node pointed at `http://wm-yourtool:port/node/execute`.

## Tips

- Test your container standalone with `docker run` before making a manifest
- Check `docker logs wm-yourtool` if your plugin fails to start
- Use the diagnostic tool (`python3 wickerman_diag.py`) to verify routing
- Plugin data in `{self}/` survives reinstalls — use it for databases and configs

SOURCE_HELP = """
## Version Control — What It Is and Why You Care

Imagine you're building a house. Every time you add a room, move a wall, or change the plumbing, someone takes a photograph of the entire house and writes a note: *"Tuesday 3pm — added kitchen window."* If you accidentally break something, you can flip back through the photos and see exactly when it changed.

That's what **Git** does for your Wickerman setup. Every time you install a plugin, change a config, or update nginx, the system takes a snapshot (called a **commit**) and writes a description of what happened.

### The Two Photo Albums

Wickerman keeps two separate histories:

**SYSTEM** (blue badges) tracks your core infrastructure — the dashboard, nginx routing, docker-compose config. These are the bones of the house.

**SUPPORT** (green badges) tracks your plugins, manifests, and customizations. These are the furniture and decorations.

They're separate because you might reinstall the system (new bones) while keeping all your plugins and models intact (same furniture).

### Reading the Timeline

Each entry in the Timeline looks like this:

> **SUPPORT** — plugin: installed wm-chat
> `a3f2c1b` — 2025-03-04 19:41:08

Here's what each piece means:

- **The badge** tells you which album this photo is in
- **The message** describes what changed in plain English
- **The short code** (like `a3f2c1b`) is a unique fingerprint for this exact snapshot — no two are alike
- **The timestamp** is when it happened

### What's a Diff?

Click the little icon next to any Timeline entry and you'll see a **diff** — a side-by-side comparison showing exactly what changed. Lines in **green** with a `+` were added. Lines in **red** with a `-` were removed.

For example, if you installed a new plugin, the diff would show the new manifest file appearing (all green). If you changed a setting, you'd see the old value in red and the new value in green.

This is incredibly useful when something breaks. You can look at the last few diffs and say *"Ah, that config change is what broke it"* instead of guessing.

### Working Changes

The "Working Changes" section shows you things that have changed since the last snapshot. Think of it like unsaved edits in a document. If this section is empty, everything is saved.

Most of the time this will be empty because Wickerman auto-saves after every significant action. But if you manually edit files on the host, those changes show up here until you commit them.

### Manual Commits

Sometimes you want to save a snapshot with your own description. Maybe you tweaked a model config, or you're about to try something experimental and want a save point first.

Type a message describing what you did (or what you're about to do) and click the commit button. Now if things go sideways, you have a named checkpoint you can refer back to.

**Pro tip:** Make a manual commit *before* you try something risky. That way you always know the last known-good state.

### Why Two Commit Buttons?

**Commit Support** saves changes in the plugins/config album — use this for anything in `~/WickermanSupport/`.

**Commit System** saves changes in the infrastructure album — use this for anything in `~/wickerman/` (dashboard, nginx, compose files).

Most of the time you'll use Commit Support, since that's where your day-to-day changes happen.
